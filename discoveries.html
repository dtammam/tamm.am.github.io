                            The same creator did it again... a day later. This one was incredible. His description says it quite eloquently: 
                            
                            "This one is very special. I was so overcome with emotion while working on this, that there were times I had to stop myself from balling out crying. Between the lyrical content, the beautiful melody, the amazing vocal arrangement, the sound of the voices - how could you not? It hits 10 times harder when you hear the backstory. From Wiki:

                            "Over the summer of 1968, Brian attempted to record an arrangement of the 1927 show tune "Ol' Man River". According to music writer Brian Chidester, the session tapes "reveal Wilson conducting the Beach Boys to such extreme perfectionism that both he and the band seem at the end of their rope with one another".[9] Singer Danny Hutton recalled that Brian had expressed suicidal wishes at the time, and that it was when his "real decline started".[10] Afterward, he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, possibly of his own volition.[11]"
                            
                            I really felt like I entered Brian's soul while working on this.
                            
                            If only they could've done this at the time."

                            An AI ‚Äòcompleted‚Äô song. I really do not care much for this band in particular but the song sounds goddamn amazing. And the guy who used AI to finish it is very good at what he does. I‚Äôve had this on repeat for the last day and it hits me emotionally the same way ‚Äòhuman‚Äô songs do.

                            The guy found out in isolating the vocal tracks that it was actually a cover of a Dionne Warwick song they were humming out. And with that info was able to get it created with AI. A little studio musing that got realized more than 50 years later.

                            I have been watching AI creations come and get pulled down very quickly. LLMs are amazing tools and we all now have access to virtually unlimited cognitive leverage for free. I am struggling to keep up with AI news/releases when most people I know don‚Äôt seem to pay attention or care. As a person following and using these tools, I don‚Äôt understand.

                            Just wanted to share a random find and express that, for all of the shenanigans, ambiguity, unrest, dissonance and general malaise, it is truly a wonderful time to be alive.
